    "\n",
    "Before I learned to program / decided I wanted to learn to do data science, I ran user-testing programs for hardware products at a tech company. There are a lot of people getting into data science, and while I still feel like a beginner at programming, I'm pretty confident in my business background. So I wanted a project to show that. When I first started, this project had almost nothing to do with business, but it just kind of bled through - the connections were already there.\n",
    "\n",
    "--> so maybe it's better to just say that? think about the message and try to get it clear.\n",
    "--> I also like this stuff anyway - ask me about the case study I wrote for a business fraternity in 2018. (I picked this restaurant because I thought the name was funny - I was going to use another restaurant I also wrote a case about called the Himalayan Chimney, but they changed their website to just an ordering screen because of covid, which wasn't as fun).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Showcasing A/B testing is hard**\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, it's hard to showcase A/B testing because you need a product and users. And every company seems to want A/B testing experience. So instead of giving up, I found a sneaky way around it. When a company does A/B testing, they just look at the data to see how users interact with a change. So instead of actually implementing a change and looking at the data, we can just regenerate data for a month and pretend that's the sales data from the users. It's just order data, so it's not as good as real-time user data (like click-through-rates or stuff like that), but it's not likely most restaurants will have that kind of data either - it's a nice, simple example.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Order IDs don't match Order Date. They're all within the hour, but they're random. It doesn't really make sense that the first order would be 10 minutes from closing, while the next order after that is halfway through the shift. The solution is probably to generate from a minute basis, but it seems like a small enough detail to skip for now. **I think this is the only real flaw in the data** - the rest are just minor inaccuracies.\n",
    "- Code is a bit slow. There are some list comprehensions in the loop that aren't very elegant because I was accessing multi-element lists in a dictionary. It felt like too much to explicitly get lists of the weight element from the dictionary, so I put it in the loop. I'm sure there's also a cleaner way I could've added options for additional orders, but will revisit when I have a deeper understanding of programming.\n",
    "- I think my usage of nested loops is appropriate here, but wow it's ugly to see that many nested loops. I'm sure I'll realize a better way to have built that in the future.\n",
    "- This applies to all of the notebooks in this project, but I think they get messy when there's too much content, and I'm a bit verbose. I'll work on it.\n",
    "- I used an exponential distribution on quantity ordered which isn't wrong, but it feels too uniformly exponential. I would imagine most orders to be one, then two through four, then some ives and sixes, then almost nothing, then a bunch of orders from corporate catering around 10. Instead, it follows a smooth exponential curve which is a bit too pretty.\n",
