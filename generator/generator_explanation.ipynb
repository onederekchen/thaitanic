    "\n",
    "Before I learned to program / decided I wanted to learn to do data science, I ran user-testing programs for hardware products at a tech company. There are a lot of people getting into data science, and while I still feel like a beginner at programming, I'm pretty confident in my business background. So I wanted a project to show that. When I first started, this project had almost nothing to do with business, but it just kind of bled through - the connections were already there.\n",
    "\n",
    "--> so maybe it's better to just say that? think about the message and try to get it clear.\n",
    "--> I also like this stuff anyway - ask me about the case study I wrote for a business fraternity in 2018. (I picked this restaurant because I thought the name was funny - I was going to use another restaurant I also wrote a case about called the Himalayan Chimney, but they changed their website to just an ordering screen because of covid, which wasn't as fun).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Showcasing A/B testing is hard**\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, it's hard to showcase A/B testing because you need a product and users. And every company seems to want A/B testing experience. So instead of giving up, I found a sneaky way around it. When a company does A/B testing, they just look at the data to see how users interact with a change. So instead of actually implementing a change and looking at the data, we can just regenerate data for a month and pretend that's the sales data from the users. It's just order data, so it's not as good as real-time user data (like click-through-rates or stuff like that), but it's not likely most restaurants will have that kind of data either - it's a nice, simple example.\n",
    "\n",

The goal is to evaluate whether or not the value went up or down, and whether it's statistically significant or just noise (e.g. the change we made actually had some impact). \n",

    "I'll look at the randomly printed value afterwards to compare. Might make a note: based on the test results, I would say this is statistically significant and would recommend this change going forward. Bonus: since it's a simulation, I'll try to guess the weight (not really sure if this is worth anything since there's so many random variation all over the place, but it's just for fun)."
